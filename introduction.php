              <div><p>University of Peradeniya is a leading university in Sri Lanka which facilitates about 9605 undergraduates in 9 different faculties.
	Student Services Branch in the University of Peradeniya provides a comprehensive service to selected number of students from each faculty by administrating and allocating 20 hostels in the university premises. There are 10 male hostels, 8 female hostels and 2 bikku hostels which provide accommodation for around 5500 undergraduates which is nearly 55% of the student population.
	Wardens and sub wardens from the academic staff are appointed by the university for different halls of residence to maintain the discipline in the hostels. Since there are large number of hostels and students, maintaining these records is a difficult task. 
       The purpose of this project is to design a database management system for hostels in the university to avoid manual data entry and keep records in a proper manner. This database system maintains information about the hostel, details about the management, staff and students in the hostel so the information can be accessed and manipulated easily.</p></div>
